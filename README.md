# AMLProject2020
Generalized Autoencoder: A Neural Network Framework for Dimensionality Reduction

## Init project
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/<path-to-project>/autoencoder"
```

## TODO
1. Report!!!
2. Compute error rate and impurity per epoch
    - We can then plot these metrics with respect to epochs
3. Run experiments for report (with current models)
4. Reproduce the error rate table from table 2 or 3.
5. Debug BalancedLDA
6. Give a second chance to the MFA (if there is time)
